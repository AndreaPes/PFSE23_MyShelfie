# My Shelfie
Politecnico di Milano — Software Engineering — _AY 2022–2023_

## About
A networked implementation of the board game [My Shelfie](https://www.craniocreations.it/prodotto/my-shelfie) by [Cranio Creations](https://www.craniocreations.it/), featuring a GUI client and a CLI server communicating over sockets. The project reproduces the original rules and gameplay for multiplayer matches.

## Goal and requirements
- Client-server architecture using Java sockets
- Multiplayer support
- Graphical user interface for the client
- Command-line interface for the server
- Game rules and mechanics implemented according to the original board game

## Advanced requirements
- Multiple matches
- Chat
- Docker

## Key learnings
- **Teamwork:** task split, code reviews, shared standards, and clear ownership.
- **Client–server architecture:** socket protocol design, request/response framing, error handling.
- **MVC & layering:** separate model, view, and controller; keep domain logic UI-agnostic.
- **Design patterns:** select and implement right patterns.
- **UML & modeling:** use case, class, sequence, and state diagrams to align understanding and validate flows.
- **GUI & CLI:** event-driven GUI; CLI parity; reuse the same core logic across both front ends.
- **Testing:** unit, integration, and scenario tests covering edge cases.
